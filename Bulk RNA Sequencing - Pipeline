The zebrafish GRCz11 FASTA and GTF files were downloaded from Ensembl release 94 and the reference database was created using STAR version 2.6.1b with splice junctions optimized for 150 base pair reads (Dobin et al 2013).  Optical duplicates were removed using clumpify v38.34 and reads  were trimmed of adapters using cutadapt 1.16 (Marcel 2011).   The trimmed reads were aligned to the reference database using STAR in two pass mode to output a BAM file sorted by coordinates.  Mapped reads were assigned to annotated genes in the GTF file using featureCounts version 1.5.1 (Liao et al 2014).  The output files from cutadapt, FastQC, Picard CollectRnaSeqMetrics, STAR and featureCounts were summarized using MultiQC to check for any sample outliers (Ewels et al 2016).   Differentially expressed genes were identified using a 5% false discovery rate with DESeq2 version 1.22.2 (Love et al 2014).
